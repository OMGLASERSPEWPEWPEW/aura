He states he wants matches 'likely to be open to intimacy quickly' but his presentation is almost entirely cerebral and romantic rather than sexual. There's no photo that communicates physical confidence, sexuality, or desire. The chain necklace in two photos is the only gesture toward masculine edge. He's signaling safety and depth, which attracts women looking for emotional connection, but may be filtering OUT women comfortable with faster physical progression. He's hoping intellectual intensity will translate to sexual chemistry, but he's not giving visual permission for matches to see him sexually first.\",\n      \"power_dynamics\": \"He clearly wants intellectual equality or even slight submission - someone who can 'challenge' him but also appreciates his knowledge. The caretaker role with his mother, combined with the 'monastic' artist identity, suggests he's most comfortable when he can be the protector/provider/teacher. However, his openness to being 'open to short term' and living above his mother reveals he knows he's not in a position of traditional male power right now. This creates an interesting tension: he wants to lead intellectually and protect emotionally, but his life circumstances require a partner who can meet him where he is rather than where he wishes he was.\",\n      \"vulnerability_indicators\": \"The mother caregiving situation is both his greatest strength signal and his deepest vulnerability. It shows character but also limits autonomy, space, and traditional dating progression. The pivot from founder to artist at 46 suggests either financial security that allows this or a midlife crisis of meaning - either way, it's a massive identity shift that carries uncertainty. His need to emphasize education (Northeastern then GWU) and occupation (artist AND coder) suggests he's protecting against being seen as directionless or unsuccessful. The 'monastic' framing is protective - it reframes social/sexual isolation as intentional discipline rather than circumstantial limitation.\",\n      \"disconnect\": \"The core contradiction: He says he wants physical intimacy quickly and is open to short-term, but everything about his presentation screams 'I need you to appreciate my MIND first.' His 100% message-first rate and low double-texting show he's interested and proactive, yet his bio is almost designed to filter for women who want slow-burn intellectual connection. He's living with his mother in a caretaker role but seeking sexual spontaneity. He's in a 'monastic' creative phase but wants intimacy. He presents as the sensitive artist-intellectual but his stated goal is more physical/casual than his energy suggests. This isn't dishonesty - it's complexity he hasn't fully integrated yet.\"\n    },\n    \"archetype_summary\": \"Deric is a Renaissance mind in a transitional life phase - too intellectually restless to be domesticated by convention, yet too duty-bound and emotionally sophisticated to be truly casual. He's the reformed tech founder who chose meaning over money, now writing fiction while caring for his aging mother. He wants a woman who sees this duality as depth rather than confusion, who can appreciate both the philosopher and the body, who understands that a man at 45 living above his mother while applying to MFA programs is either catastrophically lost or courageously reinventing himself. The women he attracts with his current presentation will want to 'understand' him - but what he's actually seeking is someone who wants to desire him first, then understand him later. Until he integrates these two needs in his presentation, he'll keep experiencing the disconnect between matches and outcomes.\"\n  },\n  \"dating_strategy\": {\n    \"ideal_partner_profile\": \"A woman in her late 30s to mid-40s who has done her own reinvention - perhaps divorced, career-shifted, or life-pivoted in a way that makes her empathetic to non-linear paths. She's intellectually curious but not performatively so - she reads for pleasure, asks good questions, and enjoys depth without needing to prove anything. Critically, she has her own secure living situation and developed life, so his mother situation is interesting rather than disqualifying. She's comfortable with physical intimacy independent of traditional relationship escalation - meaning she can enjoy the body and the mind in whatever order they develop. She likely works in a creative, educational, or caregiving field herself (therapist, teacher, designer, nonprofit) where she's learned that impact matters more than status. She lives in Roscoe Village, Lincoln Square, Ravenswood, or similarly grounded Chicago neighborhoods - not River North or Gold Coast where his situation would read as failure. She's attracted to competence and emotional availability more than financial flash.

Try: 'I make a mean Puerto Rican breakfast, care deeply about the people in my life, and yes, I'm the guy who'll explain hyperbolic geometry if you let me. Currently writing fiction, staying close to family, and looking for someone who finds curiosity as attractive as I do.' This shows warmth, culture, duty, and intellect without leading with the potentially intimidating stuff.\",\n      \"Replace 'The moment a sentence finally works' with something that shows you in action or pleasure: 'The moment I nail a kettlebell snatch. A perfectly brewed coffee. Conversation that makes me forget to check my phone.' This keeps the thoughtfulness but adds physicality and presence.\",\n      \"Add one line that gives explicit permission for physical attraction: 'I value deep conversation and physical chemistry - ideally both, in whatever order they show up.'

Example: 'I saw you mentioned loving historical fiction - have you read Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall? I'm curious if you found Cromwell sympathetic or calculating.' This shows intellectual engagement without being a know-it-all.\",\n      \"Early in conversation (within 3-4 exchanges), introduce light physical awareness or in-person suggestion without being pushy: 'I'd love to continue this over coffee - I know a great spot in Lincoln Square if you're nearby, or happy to come to you.' This tests for reciprocal interest in meeting and shows respect for her geography/boundaries.\",\n      \"Don't over-explain yourself in early messages. Your tendency will be to contextualize and provide background - resist this. Let her be curious. When she asks what you do, 'I'm a writer working on a novel, and I code to pay bills' is enough. Save the MFA applications and founder background for in-person where your warmth and presence can contextualize the complexity.\"\n    ]\n  }",
