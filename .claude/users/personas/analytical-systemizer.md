# Analytical Systemizer

**Archetype:** The Data-Driven Decoder
**Tagline:** "Show me the patterns, and I'll make my own conclusions"

## Profile Summary

The Analytical Systemizer approaches dating as a research project. They're frustrated by the ambiguity and emotional chaos of modern dating and seek tools that provide structure, data, and objective insights. They want to decode human behavior, not guess at it.

## Demographics & Context

- **Age:** 25-40
- **Tech Comfort:** High (likely in tech, engineering, science, or analytical fields)
- **Dating Experience:** Moderate to extensive, often frustrated by "wasting time"
- **Neurodivergence:** Common (ADHD, autism spectrum, or high systematizing trait)
- **Platforms:** Uses multiple dating apps simultaneously, tracks results

## Core Needs

### Primary Need
**Objective data to reduce dating uncertainty**

They're tired of:
- Reading mixed signals
- Guessing compatibility from surface traits
- Making decisions based on "vibes" alone
- The inefficiency of trial-and-error dating

They want:
- Frameworks to understand potential partners
- Data points to support/challenge their intuitions
- Patterns that help them filter more effectively
- Confidence in their assessments

### Secondary Needs
- **Control:** Ability to configure, customize, explore
- **Depth:** More detail is better than less
- **Efficiency:** Keyboard shortcuts, no unnecessary clicks
- **Consistency:** Predictable UI, reliable results

## Psychographic Profile

### Motivations
- Reduce wasted time on incompatible matches
- Understand patterns they might be missing
- Validate their own observations
- Feel confident in dating decisions

### Fears & Anxieties
- Missing obvious red flags
- Wasting months on someone incompatible
- Being manipulated due to blind spots
- Overthinking paralysis (analysis without action)

### Behaviors
- Reads every section of a dating profile thoroughly
- Takes notes on matches (mental or actual)
- Compares patterns across successful/failed dates
- Researches dating advice, psychology, attachment theory
- Prefers keyboard navigation when available

## User Journey

### Discovery
"I'm spending hours on dating apps and still can't figure out who's actually compatible. There has to be a more systematic approach."

### First Use
- Immediately explores all features
- Reads every insight card thoroughly
- Tests edge cases ("What if I upload a bad video?")
- Appreciates detailed breakdowns over summaries

### Ongoing Use
- Analyzes every serious prospect
- Compares Virtue profiles across matches
- Tracks which insights prove accurate over time
- May provide detailed feedback on incorrect predictions

### Advocacy
"If you want to actually understand who you're swiping on, you need to try this. It's like having a relationship psychologist break down every profile."

## Killer Features

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **11 Virtues System** | Structured framework replaces vague intuitions |
| **Space Virtue emphasis** | Attachment dynamics are critical for them |
| **Detailed analysis mode** | More data = better decisions |
| **Keyboard navigation** | Power users demand efficiency |
| **Compatibility explanations** | Need to understand the "why" |
| **Export/comparison** | Want to track and compare over time |

## Pain Points to Avoid

| Pain Point | Why It Hurts |
|------------|--------------|
| Vague insights | "Good match" without explanation is useless |
| Mouse-required UI | Keyboard should access everything |
| Hidden complexity | Don't dumb down the data |
| Inconsistent results | Same input should = same output |
| Slow analysis | Time is their scarcest resource |

## Quotes (Synthesized)

> "I don't need you to tell me if someone is 'good' - I need you to tell me what patterns you see so I can decide for myself."

> "The Space virtue description was the first time I understood why my last three relationships failed the same way."

> "Can I get the raw data? I want to build a spreadsheet."

> "Why can't I tab to that button?"

## Development Priorities

When building for the Analytical Systemizer:

### MUST Have
- [ ] Detailed Virtue breakdowns with explanations
- [ ] Keyboard navigation for all core flows
- [ ] Consistent, predictable analysis results
- [ ] Ability to see "why" behind every insight
- [ ] Fast analysis (respect their time)

### SHOULD Have
- [ ] Export functionality (JSON/CSV)
- [ ] Comparison view for multiple profiles
- [ ] Confidence levels on predictions
- [ ] Advanced settings/configuration
- [ ] Reduced motion option (sensory consideration)

### COULD Have
- [ ] API access for power users
- [ ] Custom virtue weighting
- [ ] Historical tracking dashboard
- [ ] Pattern detection across their matches

### WON'T Have (Explicitly)
- [ ] Gamification (badges, streaks)
- [ ] Social features (sharing, comparing with friends)
- [ ] Notification spam
- [ ] Mandatory tutorials

## Accessibility Considerations

This persona disproportionately includes neurodivergent users:

- **ADHD:** Clear visual hierarchy, no overwhelming animations, ability to hyperfocus on details
- **Autism spectrum:** Consistent UI patterns, explicit rather than implicit meaning, reduced sensory stimulation option
- **High systematizing:** Structured data presentation, logical information architecture

Build with the [Accessibility Specialist](../../agents/design/accessibility-specialist.md) for this persona.
