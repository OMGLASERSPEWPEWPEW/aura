The 11 Virtues of Love

We condense the 23 aspects into 11 high-impact spectrums.

I. The Biological Realm (Chemistry)

These are binary. If the Delta is high, the relationship usually dies.

1. Vitality (The Engine)

Spectrum: Restorative ↔ High Voltage

Low Score: Loves naps, slow mornings, cozy nights (The "Cat").

High Score: Needs gym, hiking, constant movement, productivity (The "Dog").

The Match: Low Delta Required. A High Voltage person will exhaust a Restorative person.

2. Lust (The Spark)

Spectrum: Reserved ↔ Voracious

Low Score: Values quality over quantity, demisexual, touch-sensitive.

High Score: High libido, tactile, needs physical touch to feel safe.

The Match: Low Delta Required. The "Dead Bedroom" predictor.

3. Play (The Child)

Spectrum: Serious/Grounded ↔ Absurd/Wild

Low Score: Values dignity, composure, adulthood.

High Score: Values silliness, bits, sarcasm, "goblin mode."

The Match: Medium Delta Allowed. A Serious person often needs a Wild partner to loosen them up (and vice versa).

II. The Emotional Realm (Connection)

These determine how you fight and how you bond.

4. Warmth (The Hearth)

Spectrum: Cool/Stoic ↔ Radiant/Emotive

Low Score: Shows love through acts of service, logical support, stability.

High Score: Shows love through words, gushing affirmation, tears.

The Match: Medium Delta is Dangerous. The Radiant person will often feel "starved" by the Stoic person (Anxious/Avoidant trap).

5. Voice (The Sword)

Spectrum: Diplomatic ↔ Blunt

Low Score: "Read between the lines," values harmony, hints at needs.

High Score: "Say it to my face," values radical honesty, friction is fine.

The Match: Low Delta Preferred. A Diplomat feels bullied by a Blunt person; a Blunt person feels manipulated by a Diplomat.

6. Space (The Shield)

Spectrum: Merged ↔ Autonomous

Low Score: Wants to do everything together. "We."

High Score: Needs a "Man Cave," solo trips, separate bank accounts. "I."

The Match: CRITICAL. If one is High Space and one is Low Space (Merged), this is the Toxic Anxious/Avoidant dynamic.

7. Anchor (The Root)

Spectrum: Fluid/Chaos ↔ Structured/Routine

Low Score: Spontaneous, messy, "we'll figure it out," goes with the flow.

High Score: Google Calendar, 5-year plan, clean house, distinct plans.

The Match: Medium Delta is Magic. Structure helps Chaos focus; Chaos helps Structure relax.

III. The Cerebral Realm (Mind)

These determine if you can talk for 40 years.

8. Wit (The Game)

Spectrum: Earnest ↔ Intellectual

Low Score: Likes simple, heartfelt, literal conversation.

High Score: Likes banter, debate, layers of irony, dark humor.

The Match: Low Delta Required. A High Wit person will get bored; an Earnest person will feel mocked.

9. Drive (The Mountain)

Spectrum: Content ↔ Relentless

Low Score: "Work to live." Values peace, weekends, "enough."

High Score: "Live to work." Values legacy, status, grinding, "more."

The Match: High Friction. The Relentless partner will resent the Content partner's "laziness"; the Content partner will resent being second place to the job.

10. Curiosity (The Horizon)

Spectrum: Traditional ↔ Explorer

Low Score: Likes what they like. Nostalgia. Comfort zones.

High Score: Obsessed with the new. Wikipedia rabbit holes. Changing careers.

The Match: Low Delta Preferred. Explorers need other Explorers.

11. Soul (The Meaning)

Spectrum: Pragmatic ↔ Idealist

Low Score: Atheist/Realist. "What works?" Material focus.

High Score: Spiritual/Artist. "What does it mean?" Metaphysical focus.

The Match: Flexible. Can work if they respect each other.

How the "Relativistic UI" Looks

Instead of a radar chart, you show a "Mixing Board" (Like faders on a stereo).

Example: The Dude vs. Jessica

Vitality:

Dude: 80 (High Voltage)

Jessica: 40 (Restorative)

Result: ⚠️ Friction (Delta 40). "You will need to run solo mornings; she will need slow Sundays."

Space:

Dude: 90 (Autonomous)

Jessica: 30 (Merged)

Result: 🚨 Danger (Delta 60). "She will feel ignored when you go into 'Cave Mode'. You will feel smothered."

Wit:

Dude: 85 (Intellectual)

Jessica: 80 (Intellectual)

Result: ✅ Sympatico (Delta 5). "Endless conversation. You speak the same language."

The App's "Vibe Check" Output:

"You represent a High-Intellect, High-Friction match. You will never run out of things to say (Wit Match), but you will fight about time management (Space Clash). This relationship requires 'Scheduled Independence' to survive."
