# Aura: Product Vision & Philosophy

## The Mission
Aura is not a tool to "get laid." It is an institution for **Emotional Literacy**.
We are not building a score calculator; we are building a teacher.
Our goal is to help users read subtext, identify behavioral patterns (green/red flags), and weed out toxic actors (narcissism, love bombing) before they get hurt.

## The "Antivirus" Architecture (Privacy Strategy)
To comply with Apple's strict privacy rules and our own moral compass, we use a **Local-First** approach:
1.  **User Data:** Stays on the phone (IndexedDB). We do not scrape or harvest dating profiles to a central server.
2.  **Central Wisdom:** We provide the "definitions" (therapist-verified patterns), and the phone applies them locally.
3.  **The Moat:** Our value is the curated intelligence (the "Therapist Council"), not just the code.

## Core Mandate
- **No Black Box:** The user should learn *why* a flag is red.
- **Privacy:** We are a digital diary, not a data broker.
- **Tone:** Empathetic, firm, educational. "Nosce Te Ipsum" (Know Thyself).

## Product Principles

### 1. Teach, Don't Tell
Every insight should come with an explanation. When we flag something as a red flag, we explain the psychological principle behind it. Users should leave every session slightly wiser about human behavior.

### 2. Empower, Don't Enable
We help users make better decisions, not avoid decisions altogether. The goal is to build judgment, not dependency.

### 3. Privacy as Feature
Local-first isn't just a technical choice—it's a trust signal. Users can be honest with themselves when they know nobody else is watching.

### 4. Psychological Safety
We discuss difficult topics (manipulation, toxicity, attachment issues) with clinical precision and compassion. No judgment, just clarity.

## The User Journey

1. **Discovery:** User uploads a dating profile screenshot
2. **Analysis:** AI reveals patterns and subtext they might miss
3. **Learning:** User understands *why* certain signals matter
4. **Action:** User makes informed decisions about who to pursue
5. **Reflection:** Over time, user develops their own pattern recognition

## Success Metrics (What We Care About)

- **Insight Quality:** Are users learning something new?
- **Decision Confidence:** Do users feel more confident in their choices?
- **Emotional Safety:** Are we helping users avoid harm?
- **Return Usage:** Do users find ongoing value?

## What We Don't Optimize For

- Engagement for its own sake
- Maximizing matches or dates
- Validating poor choices
- Creating dependency on the tool
