This is a brilliant system architecture question. You are essentially asking to build a "Character Sheet" for Real Life.

In Ultima Online, the system was based on 8 Virtues derived from 3 Principles (Truth, Love, Courage). In our Dojo Dating System, we can derive virtues from the core components of Storytelling and Scene Dynamics: Motivation (Desire), Conflict (Wounds), and Tactics (Action).

To make this digestible for the public, we cannot use clinical terms like "Trauma," "Avoidance," or "Narcissism." We must translate these psychological "Wounds" into Virtues (Values/Strengths).

Here is the System of the 23 Aspects (23 is a prime number, irreducible, just like the core self).

The Architecture: 3 Realms, 23 Virtues

We categorize the 23 Virtues into three Realms of the Human Experience:

The Realm of Vitality (Body & Action) – How they move through the world.

The Realm of Connection (Heart & Spirit) – How they bond with others.

The Realm of Structure (Mind & Environment) – How they organize their reality.

Each user gets a score (0–100) on these 23 traits.

How We Present This to the User (The "UI")

We don't show them a list of their traumas. We show them their "Virtue Constellation" (a Radar Chart).

Example: The Dude's Profile (Based on your uploads)

Dominant Virtues: Curiosity (Writing), Autonomy (Lone Wolf), Vitality (Running), Wit (Banter), Purpose (New Path).

Shadow/Needs: Your High Autonomy means you need a partner with High Grace (doesn't smother you). Your High Curiosity means you need High Wit (Sheena/Jessica).

Example: Jessica's Profile

Dominant Virtues: Aesthetic (Old Houses), Order (Consistency), Grace (Hospitality), Curiosity (Literacy).

The Match: Her Order + Your Purpose = Stability. Her Aesthetic + Your Curiosity = Great dates (Map Room).
