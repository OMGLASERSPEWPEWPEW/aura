| **Honest** | We tell you what we see, tactfully | Not harsh or judgmental |
| **Empowering** | We help you make better decisions | Not making decisions for you |
| **Playful** | Dating should have moments of lightness | Not silly or unserious |

### Brand Voice

**We Sound Like:**
A wise, supportive friend who happens to have a psychology degree. They give you real talk but always with kindness. They're smart but never make you feel dumb. They find the humor in dating struggles while taking your feelings seriously.

   - NO: "Warning: This person will probably ghost you"

5. **Playful, Not Frivolous**
   - YES: "Their playlist probably has some surprises"
   - NO: "LOL they're totally a Scorpio"
