## Entry: 2026-01-28
**Topic:** Slash Commands
**Key Concepts:**
- Type `/` to open the command menu instantly
- Built-in commands: `/help`, `/clear`, `/compact`, `/config`, `/mcp`, `/add-dir`
- Custom commands go in `.claude/commands/` (project) or `~/.claude/commands/` (global)
- Commands are Markdown files that can accept `$ARGUMENTS`
- `/mcp` toggles MCP servers on/off without restarting
**Mastery Level:** Introduced
**Next Steps:** Create a simple custom command in `.claude/commands/` to practice
