The Options Explained                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                          
  Think of Aura like a restaurant. Right now we have amazing food (the AI analysis), but we're missing things customers   
  expect:

  Option 1: Polish Sprint (1 week)                                                                                        
                                                                                                                          
  What it is: Fix the "little things" that make an app feel modern and professional.                                      
                                                                                                                          
  Includes:                                                                                                               
  - Search bar - Find profiles by name (currently impossible!)                                                            
  - Swipe to delete - Like deleting emails on your phone                                                                  
  - Pull down to refresh - The gesture everyone does instinctively                                                        
  - Better "empty" screens - When you first open the app, guide you on what to do                                         
                                                                                                                          
  Why choose this: Makes the app feel "finished." Users won't notice these features, but they'll notice if they're        
  missing. Low risk, solid polish.

  Option 2: Growth Features (2-3 weeks)                                                                                   
                                                                                                                          
  What it is: Features that get new users excited and keep existing users coming back.                                    
                                                                                                                          
  Includes:                                                                                                               
  - Analyze YOUR profile - "What does my dating profile say about me?" (People love sharing this stuff on social media)   
  - Compare two matches - "Should I go out with Alex or Jordan?" side-by-side                                             
  - Welcome tutorial - First-time users actually understand what to do                                                    
  - Full search + filters - Find matches by app, compatibility score, etc.                                                
                                                                                                                          
  Why choose this: These are the features that make people tell their friends about Aura. The self-analysis feature       
  especially has viral potential.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                          
  ---                                                                                                                     
  Option 3: Lifecycle Expansion (3-4 weeks)                                                                               
                                                                                                                          
  What it is: Track what happens AFTER you analyze someone - the full dating journey.                                     
                                                                                                                          
  Includes:                                                                                                               
  - Notes on profiles - "Met at coffee shop" or "Ghosted after date 2"                                                    
  - Track interactions - Did you send that opener? Did they respond?                                                      
  - Post-date reflections - "How did the date go?" tracking                                                               
  - Pattern dashboard - "Here's what types of people you keep matching with"                                              
                                                                                                                          
  Why choose this: Turns Aura from a "one-time analysis tool" into a "dating companion" you use throughout your dating    
  journey. Deeper engagement, but more work.                                                                              
                                                                                                                          
  ---                                                                                                                     
  My Recommendation                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                          
  If I were advising:                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                          
  1. If you want quick wins before monetization: Option 1 (Polish Sprint)                                                 
  2. If you want to grow the user base: Option 2 (Growth Features) - the self-analysis viral potential is huge            
  3. If you want deeper engagement: Option 3 (Lifecycle)                                                                  
                                                                                                                          
  Or combine: Start with Option 1's quick wins (3-4 days), then tackle Option 2's self-analysis feature (the viral one).

      set to identify "table stakes" gaps - features users would expect but are                                           
     missing.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                          
     Key Finding: Aura has exceptional depth of AI analysis but lacks breadth                                             
      of organizational and workflow features. We're like a luxury car with no cup
