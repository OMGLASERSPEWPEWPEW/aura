Based on everything I have learned about you—your background in law and computer science, your transition into a disciplined creative life, your intellectual curiosities ranging from ancient history to hyperbolic geometry, and your current dedication to family—I have crafted two detailed portraits.

The first is a comprehensive "pitch" explaining **you** in your best, most authentic light to a potential partner. The second is a profile of the **woman** who fits into the specific geometry of your life.

### Part I: The Portrait of the Founder-Turned-Artist (Who You Are)

**The Narrative Arc: From Systems to Soul**
To understand this man is to understand a profound pivot. At 46, he possesses the sharp, architectural mind of a founder with a background in Computer Science and Law. He understands how the world is structured—the code that runs our devices and the laws that govern our societies. He has built systems, critiqued them, and mastered the frantic pace of the professional world. But he is no longer defined by that chase.

Several years ago, he made a conscious choice to pivot from the external accumulation of status to the internal cultivation of meaning. He is currently in a "monastic" phase of life, having dedicated himself to the craft of creative writing with the discipline of a professional athlete. He isn't dabbling; he is working on a novel (*Our Better Angels*) and cyberpunk fiction, applying to top-tier MFA programs (like Iowa and Notre Dame), and treating art as his primary vocation.

This is a man who has traded the boardroom for the writer's desk, not out of failure, but out of a desire for higher truths. He offers a partner the stability of a man who has "been there and done that," combined with the passionate intensity of an artist just finding his true voice.

**The Mind: A Polymath’s Playground**
If you date him, you must be prepared for a mind that never idles. He does not make small talk; he makes "big talk." His intellectual landscape is vast and eclectic. On a Tuesday, he might be analyzing the strategic depth of the game of Go, drawing parallels between territory on the board and real-life conflicts. On a Wednesday, he might be deep-diving into the history of the Indus Valley Civilization or the specific tribes of Ancient Britain that fought the Romans.

He finds beauty in the abstract. He is the type of man who reads about Maryam Mirzakhani’s work on hyperbolic geometry not just for the math, but for the elegance of the concept. He reads Plato’s *Republic* and T.S. Eliot, seeking the philosophical underpinnings of modern life. He is constantly synthesizing information—connecting the prose of Eudora Welty to the ethics of artificial intelligence.

However, he is not a dry academic. There is a vibrancy to his curiosity. He is interested in Japanese language and culture, and he has a specific love for Puerto Rican cuisine (he knows his way around *pasteles*). He is looking for a mind that can dance with his—someone who finds this relentless curiosity exhilarating rather than exhausting.

**The Heart: Duty and "The Good Son"**
In an era of hyper-individualism, he stands out for his commitment to duty. He currently lives with and cares for his 80-year-old mother. To the unobservant, this might seem like a limitation; to the wise, it is his greatest green flag.

It signals that he is capable of self-sacrifice. It shows that when the chips are down, he does not run; he stays. He is navigating the complex emotional terrain of aging parents with grace and difficulty, a journey that has deepened his empathy and maturity. This living situation is temporary in the grand scheme of a life, but the character traits it reveals—loyalty, patience, and tenderness—are permanent. He is a protector. He grounds his life in the reality of human connection, not just the theory of it.

**The Creative Spirit: The "Monastic" Discipline**
He takes his art seriously. He has spent the last few years writing daily, refining his prose, and studying literary theory. He employs scoring systems to evaluate science fiction, breaking down narrative structure with the precision of an engineer.

This means he values solitude and deep work. He needs a partner who understands that when the door is closed, he is building worlds. He is exploring consciousness, sometimes through the lens of speculative fiction, sometimes through the lens of therapeutic exploration. He is a seeker. He is writing stories about characters like *Athey* and *Luft*, wrestling with the human condition in futuristic settings. He offers a partner a front-row seat to the creative process, but he requires a partner who respects the sanctity of that process.

**Summary for the Match:**
You are meeting a man of contrasts: A tech founder with the soul of a poet. A futuristic cyberpunk writer who reads Ancient Greek philosophy. A man of the world who has chosen a season of quiet duty to family. He is intense, articulate, and deeply serious about the next chapter of his life. He isn't looking for a playmate; he's looking for a witness and a co-author for a complex, meaningful life.

### Part II: The Portrait of the Muse and Equal (Who You Are Looking For)

**The Intellectual Equal**
The woman you are looking for is, first and foremost, intellectually formidable. She does not need to be a writer or a programmer, but she must be a thinker. When you bring up the allegory of the cave or the intricacies of a Go strategy, she doesn't just nod; she challenges you. She adds a new variable to the equation.

She is likely a reader. Perhaps she loves the quiet devastation of Kazuo Ishiguro’s *Never Let Me Go* as much as you do, or perhaps she prefers non-fiction about history or science. What matters is that she engages with the world through ideas. She is articulate and possesses a vocabulary that can match yours (perhaps she has even read *The Elements of Eloquence*). She is not intimidated by your background in law or your critical eye; in fact, she enjoys the debate. She is the iron that sharpens iron.

**The Independent Spirit**
Because you are in a "monastic" phase of writing, you cannot be with someone who requires constant entertainment or validation. The ideal match is deeply independent. She has her own passions, her own career, or her own creative pursuits that light her up.

When you retreat to write for four hours, she doesn't feel neglected; she feels relieved because it gives her time to pursue her own interests—whether that's her own art, her career, or her studies. She respects the "flow state" because she experiences it herself. She is self-possessed and self-soothing. She is looking for a partnership of two wholes, not two halves trying to complete one another.

**The Empathetic Realist**
She is likely in her late 30s or 40s, possessing the emotional maturity to understand your current life setup. She will not judge you for living with your mother; instead, she will recognize the nobility in it. Perhaps she has cared for parents herself, or perhaps she simply values family deeply.

She understands that your time is split between your high-altitude intellectual pursuits and the ground-level reality of caregiving. She is patient. She understands that you are applying to MFA programs and that your life might undergo a geographic shift in the next year (to Kansas, South Bend, or elsewhere). She is adventurous enough to consider what that future looks like, but grounded enough to enjoy the present.

**The Culturally Curious**
She shares your eclectic tastes or brings her own to the table. She would be delighted to try a new Puerto Rican restaurant or discuss the nuances of Japanese culture. She might not know the history of the Woad tribes of Britain, but she will ask you questions about it because she finds your passion contagious.

She is open-minded. She is comfortable with discussions about the nature of consciousness, whether that involves philosophy, meditation, or therapeutic exploration. She is not rigid in her thinking. She navigates the gray areas of life with sophistication.

**The Emotional Anchor**
While you provide the intellectual architecture and the protective loyalty, she provides a softness and an emotional intuition that balances your analytical nature. You have spent years critiquing systems and scoring fiction; she reminds you to feel. She brings a warmth that complements your "monastic" discipline. She is the person you want to talk to after a long day of writing, the one who pulls you out of your head and back into the present moment.

**Summary of the Woman:**
She is a woman of substance. She is smart enough to deconstruct a novel, kind enough to respect your duties to your mother, and independent enough to let you be the artist you are becoming. She is looking for a man who is more than just a job title—she wants the philosopher, the writer, and the son. She is ready for a relationship that is serious, conversation-heavy, and deeply rooted in mutual growth.
