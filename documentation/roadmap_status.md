# Project Status & Roadmap

## ✅ Completed (MVP Phase 1)
- [x] Project Scaffolding & Tailwind Setup.
- [x] Video Upload & Frame Extraction (iOS compatible).
- [x] AI Integration (Vision analysis of profiles).
- [x] JSON Parsing Reliability (Fixed markdown bugs).
- [x] Local Database (Save/Delete profiles).
- [x] Home Screen Gallery (with App Badges: Hinge, Tinder, Bumble).
- [x] Detail View (Green/Red flags, subtext analysis).

## 🚧 Next Immediate Steps (Phase 2: Context)
1.  **User Backstory:** Create a "Profile" page for the *User* (Alice) to input her own goals/values so the AI knows who it is advising.
2.  **Therapist Logic:** Refine the system prompt to be less generic and more "Clinical Psychologist."
3.  **Offline Polish:** Ensure the app handles being offline gracefully (viewing past profiles).

## 🔮 Future (Phase 3)
- **Chat Analysis:** analyzing screenshots of text conversations.
- **PWA Manifest:** Making it installable as a home screen app icon.
