\f0\fs22 \cf2 \up0 \nosupersub \ulnone **Scene & Dialogue Basics -- With Agendas & Tactics**\
\
Scenes are dynamic story segments that move story forward and reveal\
character. Write your scenes freely and then, when in review mode, go\
back and see if you can improve them by applying the concepts below.\
\
You often hear a "scene" defined as an event that happens in one time\
and location but this may not always be the case. It's perhaps more\
helpful to think of a scene as a unit of story in which [something is\
altered.]\{.underline\}\
\
**SCENE FUNDAMENTALS**\
\
Well-defined characters have [motivations]\{.underline\} (underlying\
psychological needs, also known as [unmet desires]\{.underline\}) that\
drive them through life and through the story. Within every compelling\
story, characters have [goals]\{.underline\} that arise from these\
motivations as well as goals that arise from the particular\
[problem]\{.underline\} that befalls them at beginning of the story. A\
well-defined [story problem]\{.underline\} will be the very thing that\
most hits the buttons of the character's insecurities and unmet\
desires and thus generates [conflict]\{.underline\} (opposition /\
antagonistic forces that oppose the character's drive to meet their\
goal)\
\
that not only generates story material but also forces the character\
to [change]\{.underline\}. It is the appearance of the story problem\
that jumpstarts the story into forward gear and it poses a [central\
question]\{.underline\}. Will the character solve their story problem?\
\
Story is composed of characters striving to solve their problem and\
meet their goals and desires while being [opposed]\{.underline\} by\
[confrontations]\{.underline\} with [antagonistic forces]\{.underline\}\
that stand in their way. This is the essence of [conflict]\{.underline\}\
and conflict is necessary in every story and the vast majority of\
scenes. Common sources of [conflict/opposition/antagonist\
forces]\{.underline\} include character vs. character; character vs.\
self; character vs. nature; character vs. society; character vs.\
technology or the supernatural.\
\
In scenes where they encounter opposition, characters will have\
[agendas]\{.underline\} and use [tactics]\{.underline\} to overcome the\
opposition and meet their agenda (get what they want). Scenes that\
have a clear [win, lose or draw]\{.underline\} for characters in regard\
to their agenda and in which something important to the story is\
[altered]\{.underline\}, are most effective in moving the story forward.\
\
**SCENES WITH OTHER CHARACTERS**\
\
Characters in scenes with other characters will use\
[tactics]\{.underline\} to meet their [agendas]\{.underline\} in the\
scene. Often the tactics are verbal and a part of dialogue, but not\
always. Many of the tactic verbs below can also describe physical\
action or behind the scenes scheming.\
\

4 Basic **Agendas\\*** (goals) in a scene with other characters:\
\
 \'95 Find out something important.\
\
 \'95 Convince someone of something important.\
\
 \'95 Make another character feel good.\
\
 \'95 Make another character feel bad.\
\
**[Tactics]\{.underline\}**\\*: How characters fight for their agendas\
\
Think of tactics as **strong, active verbs**. There are countless\
possibilities! A very few are listed below.\
\
 \'95 Agree\
\
 \'95 Applaud\
\
 \'95 Beg\
\
 \'95 Concur\
\
 \'95 Fight\
\
 \'95 Flatter\
\
 \'95 Reassure\
\
 \'95 Reward\
\
 \'95 Sympathize\
\
 \'95 Bully\
\
 \'95 Condemn\
\
 \'95 Deny\
\
 \'95 Dismiss\
\
 \'95 Dominate\
\
 \'95 Hurt\
\
 \'95 Bargain\
\
 \'95 Beg\
\
 \'95 Cajole\
\
 \'95 Coerce\
\
 \'95 Demand\
\
 \'95 Exhort\
\
 \'95 Obstruct\
\
 \'95 Overcome\
\
 \'95 Placate\
\
 \'95 Promise\
\
 \'95 Seduce\
\
 \'95 Stonewall\
\

\
 \'95 Subdue\
\
 \'95 Taunt\
\
 \'95 Tease\
\
 \'95 Threaten\
\
 \'95 Whine\
\
 **[Subtext]\{.underline\}:** Just as in real life, characters rarely say\
 what they really mean in interactions with others especially when the\
 [stakes]\{.underline\} are high (they have a lot to lose).\
\
 Other characters -- and audiences -- have to read beneath the text --\
 what is actually said -- to glean the true meaning lurking beneath\
 what a character says.\
\
 The way the character fights for what they want, the hints at what's\
 really driving them or how they really feel, tells audiences a great\
 deal about [who these characters]\{.underline\} [are]\{.underline\}. In\
 addition, their [backstory]\{.underline\}, things about their past, may\
 be inadvertently revealed and this always lends interest for\
 audiences. Audiences love to figure out the secrets that characters\
 may be hiding and how those secrets may be fueling their [unmet\
 desires]\{.underline\} and their [motivations]\{.underline\} to meet them.\
\
 **[Characters change]\{.underline\} in scenes!** Characters change as a\
 result of strong scenes. It can be said that there are character arcs\
 in significant scenes. Characters are different at the end of the\
 scene than they were at the beginning.\
\
 **[Win, lose or draw]\{.underline\}\\*\\*** -- Underlying how they are\
 different at the end of a scene is whether the character [wins, loses\
 or draws]\{.underline\} in their attempt to meet their\
 [agenda]\{.underline\} in the scene. Writers need some "lose scenes"\
 (antagonistic forces defeat the character and they can't meet their\
 agenda) so that the character is forced to change direction in order\
 to try to meet their goals or the story loses interest. The more the\
 character is forced to step up to the plate and [change]\{.underline\}\
 to move their goal forward, the higher the [stakes]\{.underline\} (what\
 they have invested and hence, the more they have to lose) and the more\
 invested the [audience]\{.underline\} is in their success.\
\
 **Story changes:** A **main (or central) event\\*** is required in the\
 scene-- a development, discovery, action or decision, among other\
 possibilities -- that changes the story and moves it forward. A scene\
 is a unit of story in which [something significant in the\
 story]\{.underline\} [is altered.]\{.underline\}\
\
 **[Beats]\{.underline\}\\* -** So that your audience can follow along and\
 keep track of what is going on in scenes, it's helpful to think of\
 writing in beats -- covering one topic, one emotion, or one action --\
 at a time before moving on to another topic, emotion or action. The\
 change of beats represent [turning points]\{.underline\} in scenes that\
 lend dynamism to them, dynamism that is unpredictable and often\
 overturns the power differential between characters in scenes,\
 sometimes even multiple times, resulting in surprising\
 [wins,]\{.underline\} [losses, or draws]\{.underline\} for the various\
 characters in scenes. It's interesting to think how "one topic, one\
 emotion, one action" echoes the alternation of "reflection, action and\
 emotion" available to writers, another alternation that creates\
 dynamism and increases audience engagement to the present tense\
 unfolding of the story.\
\

\
 **Dialogue Basics**\
\
 \'95 Each character has a specific, distinguishable way of speaking. What\
 turns of phrase does your character frequently use? What is your\
 character's [lexicon]\{.underline\}? What words does your character use\
 to refer to the important concepts and people in their life: friend\
 and friendship, family and specific people in the family, home,\
 country, God, ambition, success, love and lover, sex, money, etc.\
\
 \'95 Generally speaking, dialogue is most dynamic when it is\
 [condensed]\{.underline\}, [reveals]\{.underline\} the individuality of\
 characters in how they think and speak and is used as a\
 [vehicle]\{.underline\} for characters to get what they want.\
\
 \'95 In scenes where characters have strong agendas, it's helpful to\
 experiment with the notion of [each line of dialogue utilizing a\
 tactic]\{.underline\} (described by a strong action verb) the character\
 uses to advance their agenda.\
\
 \'95 It's good practice to let these agenda lines land one by one and\
 allow other characters to react to them in some way, even\
 non-verbally, rather than combining a number of different lines into\
 long character speeches.)\
\
 \'95 One of the marks of an accomplished writer, particularly in\
 screenwriting, is how pared down, yet effective, their dialogue is.\
\
 \'95 Stakes are high in this kind of a scene where each character has a\
 lot to lose. Dialogue here should build to a clear win, lose or draw\
 for each character. \'95 The exception to the "pared down" rule is "hero\
 speeches," long passages of\
\
 dialogue in which a character lets loose dialogue that defines the\
 character and lets us know what is important to them now. A great\
 example is Erin Brockovich's "numbers" scene in the movie of the same\
 name. Actors look for "hero speeches" in scripts, moments when the\
 camera is on them for a long time and they are saying something\
 significant in a high-conflict scene, to help determine whether or not\
 this is a part they want to play.\
\
 Yet there are degrees to how high-stakes/high conflict a scene\
 [needs]\{.underline\} to be.\
\
 \'95 Dialogues can be discussions and debates as well as overt\
 disagreements and arguments.\
\
 \'95 Writers can also leaven high-conflict scenes with scenes that\
 establish camaraderie, reveal how clever the speakers are, tell us\
 more about the characters' environment and perhaps set us up for\
 events to come.\
\
 \'95 Sometimes scenes exist mainly to allow characters to voice their\
 innermost thoughts to a confidant, often after a series of tumultuous\
 events, giving audiences a respite from the action and insight into\
 how events are affecting the character. Scenes like this are\
 especially important in action-based stories to help maintain audience\
 connection to the character.\
\

\
 **Questions and qualities to demand of your scenes while writing:**\
\
 1\\. What are the [agendas/objectives]\{.underline\} of each of your\
 scenes by character? 2. What [tactics]\{.underline\} do they use to meet\
 their agendas?\
\
 3\\. Who wins, who loses, who draws? How are the characters changed?\
 How is the story changed?\
\
4\\. For at least some characters, what they think will happen is\
[subverted]\{.underline\} in dynamic scenes. Surprising characters and\
audiences in scenes is highly desirable. Something is definitely\
[altered.]\{.underline\}\
\
> 5\\. Preload your scene with as many advance character\
 [expectations]\{.underline\} going in as possible.\
\
 6\\. To help set up your scenes, ask yourself:\
\
 
\f1 \uc0\u9642 
\f0  What happened to the characters right before they entered this\
 scene? What kind of mood are they in?\
\
 
\f1 \uc0\u9642 
\f0  What happened the last time these characters were together? Play the\
 unresolved emotion from what happened to them when they were last\
 together.\
\
 
\f1 \uc0\u9642 
\f0  What [just]\{.underline\} happened between or to the characters in the\
 scene now unfolding before the scene [turned]\{.underline\} suddenly in\
 a different direction? Play the unresolved emotion from what just\
 happened between or to them in the scene.\
\
 
\f1 \uc0\u9642 
\f0  How can you make the encounter turns out to be far more emotional\
 than expected?\
\
 
\f1 \uc0\u9642 
\f0  Who wins and who loses in the scene? Is there a character for whom\
 the scene is just a draw?\
\
 7\\. Strive to have at least one character end up doing something or\
 saying something he or she didn't intend to do at the beginning of the\
 scene. If you can write both of them such that they do or say\
 something they didn't intend to, even better.\
\
 8\\. Strive to have least one of the characters resort to\
 [indirect]\{.underline\} tricks or traps, not just direct confrontation,\
 to get what they want. If both do, even better.\
\
 9\\. Up the tension by using a resistant environment or a distracted\
 character.\
\
 
\f2 \uc0\u10070 
\f0  The environment presents physical challenges.\
\
 
\f2 \uc0\u10070 
\f0  The environment is inappropriate for confrontation. Example, the\
 film, *When Harry Met Sally*, the characters are arguing in a public\
 place, a diner over whether or not women fake orgasms all the time.\
 Sally uses the tactic of faking a convincing orgasm right there in the\
 diner to make her point. She *wins* the\
\

\
 argument Another female diner watches in fascination and then tells\
 the waiter, "I'll have what she's having." This scene and this film\
 are often mentioned as the epitome of romantic comedy writing. Nora\
 Ephron and Rob Reiner collaborated for years to write this movie. See\
 the book *Writing the Romantic Comedy* by Billy Mernit.\
\
 
\f2 \uc0\u10070 
\f0  The character has been interrupted by their scene partner and\
 doesn't want to stop doing what they're doing.\
\
 
\f2 \uc0\u10070 
\f0  There is a ticking clock operating within the scene. Examples:\
\
 
\f3 \uc0\u11162 
\f0  A character has to leave, is late for work or has an important\
 assignation. They have to pick up their child by a certain time, or\
 get somewhere specific before it closes.\
\
 
\f3 \uc0\u11162 
\f0  Characters have to resolve something before others notice their\
 absence. 
\f3 \uc0\u11162 
\f0  One character has to tell another something before another\
 character comes back or another anticipated interruption is about to\
 occur.\
\
 
\f3 \uc0\u11162 
\f0  A matter has to be addressed between characters before medication or\
 other biological processes kick in.\
\
 
\f3 \uc0\u11162 
\f0  Someone or something else needs a character's immediate attention,\
 perhaps involving high stakes such as an accident, an impending\
 disaster or a medical emergency.\
\
 10\\. Build the scene to a climax but don't have the characters\
 "process" it afterwards and talk about what just happened. Never, ever\
 have characters narrate in dialogue what just happened.\
\
 **Extra credit**\
\
 \'95 The scene doesn't only engage a character's outer goal but touches\
 on their inner wound/erroneous world view/Big Lie/flaw. An example,\
 the *Breaking Away* movie (1979 Best Original Screenplay Oscar), where\
 at [the climax]\{.underline\}, Dave bicycles "like an Italian," crossing\
 into Bloomington where Indiana University is located. As a local,\
 townie "cutter" related to the stonecutters who cut the stones to\
 build the University, Dave and his familiars have longstanding,\
 cultural conflict with the I.U. students with Dave especially in\
 conflict with them over bicycle racing and a female student and he\
 opposes the University on principle, refusing to even consider an\
 opportunity to\
\
 study there. After Dave wins the international bicycling race and\
 "crosses into Bloomington," he enrolls at the University and begins a\
 relationship with an actual French student(he's obsessed with all\
 things Italian, and then... French). It's that win, along with the\
 other events of the story, that enables Dave to let go of his\
 erroneous world view about his relationship to the University and grow\
 to become ["the hero he]\{.underline\} [was meant to be."]\{.underline\}\
\
 \'95 Counterpoint: Add an oddly funny note to a serious scene or\
 introduce a serious note into a comedy scene.\
\
 \'95 Maximize irony especially if you're working in a lighter or comedic\
 vein.\
