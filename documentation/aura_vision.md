# Aura: Product Vision & Philosophy

## The Mission
Aura is not a tool to "get laid." It is an institution for **Emotional Literacy**.
We are not building a score calculator; we are building a teacher. 
Our goal is to help users read subtext, identify behavioral patterns (green/red flags), and weed out toxic actors (narcissism, love bombing) before they get hurt.

## The "Antivirus" Architecture (Privacy Strategy)
To comply with Apple's strict privacy rules and our own moral compass, we use a **Local-First** approach:
1.  **User Data:** Stays on the phone (IndexedDB). We do not scrape or harvest dating profiles to a central server.
2.  **Central Wisdom:** We provide the "definitions" (therapist-verified patterns), and the phone applies them locally.
3.  **The Moat:** Our value is the curated intelligence (the "Therapist Council"), not just the code.

## Core Mandate
- **No Black Box:** The user should learn *why* a flag is red.
- **Privacy:** We are a digital diary, not a data broker.
- **Tone:** Empathetic, firm, educational. "Nosce Te Ipsum" (Know Thyself).
